## Summary 

With our first graph, we see that trip durations are mostly in the first hour with the first 30 mins being the most common amount of time individuals use the bikes. With our second graph, we see that males are more likely to use the bikes than women and that their trip durations tend to last a little bit longer. With our third graph, we see that afternoon times are when bike use is at its highest. With our fourth graph, we see that males use the bikes in the afternoon a lot more than females.
